### Hi there 👋

My name is Stephen Flynn and I am  full stack developer in Columbus, OH. Prior to being a developer, I've spent 5 years as Emerging Technologies Librarian and 7 years as an 8th grade History teacher.

My recent projects:
 - 🚀 [Developer portfolio](https://github.com/sxflynn/portfolio) - Deployed to https://www.sxflynn.net
 - 🗳️ [Upper Arlington School Board Election Predictor](https://github.com/sxflynn/electionsim) - Deployed to https://www.ballotbear.app
 - 🐋 Docker template projects, such as [Dockerize Your Capstone](https://github.com/sxflynn/dockerizeyourcapstone) and [Side Project Starter](https://github.com/sxflynn/sideprojectstarter)

Domain Expertise:
 - 📚 Library Information Systems
 - 🏫 K12 Ed-tech

My favorite GitHub project right now
 - [Mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine) - A fully featured React component library

I'm currently working on:
 - Side Project Suggestion: An AI prompt wrapper that will help a developer student come up with side project ideas based on their skills and interests
    - the purpose is to skill up on the OpenAI API so that I can move on to function calling and possibly Lang Chain

My future projects are:
 - TeacherGPT - a conceptual RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application AI chatbot that know about their students, using a fake school database.

My future project ideas are:
 - A desktop GUI application that helps you view, filter and search video file metadata on your computer, like iTunes but for video files.
 - A manual-entry budgeting app that helps you pace your spending by showing you daily rollover budgets.
